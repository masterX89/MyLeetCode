## 问题描述

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## 自己的解法

### JavaScript解法1:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
            if (numbers[j] === target - numbers[i]) {
                return [i+1,j+1];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
